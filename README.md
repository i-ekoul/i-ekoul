### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**i-ekoul/i-ekoul** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a system that allows for clients to check in animals to a grooming spa.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java & Python languages.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything within my knowledge bracket.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with polymorphism and abstraction techniques.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Milk hates me.
